#    CustomFT_AuctionHouseBot.MaxBuyoutPriceInCopper
#        Maximum amount that a buyout on a listing can be in copper.  Prevents
#        overflow.  Don't increase this, but you can decrease it.
#    Default 1000000000 (100k gold)
#
#    CustomFT_AuctionHouseBot.BuyoutVariationReducePercent
#    CustomFT_AuctionHouseBot.BuyoutVariationAddPercent
#        After a price is calculated using the price from database, it is randomized 
#        within a band up to +AddPercent and down to -ReducePercent
#    Default 0.15 (down) and 0.25 (up) - Which means the price range -15% or up +25%
#        Note: Do not go negative on either number.  Setting both to 0 will cause
#        no price variation at all
#
#    CustomFT_AuctionHouseBot.BidVariationHighReducePercent
#    CustomFT_AuctionHouseBot.BidVariationLowReducePercent
#        After the buyout amount is calculated, this is how much deeper down
#        the bid price can be.  It will range from buyout-HighReduce to buyout-LowReduce
#        percent
#    Default 0 (high) and .25 (low) - Starting bid will be Buyout (high) and Buyout-25% (low)
#        Note: Do not go negative on either number.  Set both to 0 if you want bids
#        to always be exactly buyout for both buyer and seller.

# BUYER PROPERTIES (Prepared for future use)
#    Note: Buyer bot is currently disabled and prepared for future implementation
#
#    CustomFT_AuctionHouseBot.Buyer.Enabled
#        Enable/Disable the buying bot.
#    Default: false (disabled)
#
#    CustomFT_AuctionHouseBot.Buyer.BuyCandidatesPerBuyCycle
#        How many to items to price and attempt to buy.  Note, this number of
#        items will be selected from each of the auction house types (Alliance,
#        Horde, Neutral).  Meaning if you set this as 10, then up to 10 items
#        from each AH will be selected (total of 30).  Whole numbers only.
#        Very large values can impact server performance, and is generally 
#        not neccessary. This runs once every Buy/Sell cycle as defined 
#        by CustomFT_AuctionHouseBot.AuctionHouseManagerCyclesBetweenBuyOrSell.
#        Value can be a single number in order to consider buying X items each
#        Buy/Sell cycle, or a pair of numbers separated by a ':' to consider 
#        buying a random number between X and Y items. (e.g. 1:5 to consider 1-5 items)
#    Default: 1 (1 item per auction house is considered per Buy/Sell cycle)
#
#    CustomFT_AuctionHouseBot.Buyer.AcceptablePriceModifier
#        The buyer bot calculates item prices the same way the selling
#        bot does, then multiplies that value by this number to determine
#        how much it is willing to spend.
#        A value of 1 means the buyer bot will generally pay the same as the
#        seller bot lists. Similarly, a value of 1.5 means it will pay roughly
#        50% more than the seller bot's listed price.  Can be less than 1 if you
#        want the buyer to be more stingy (0.5 means buyer will pay up to 50%
#        of what the seller sells for), but do not go lower than 0
#    Default: 1
#
#    CustomFT_AuctionHouseBot.Buyer.AlwaysBidMaxCalculatedPrice
#        When enabled, the buyer bot will use the calculated max price they
#        were willing to pay as the amount they bid with, instead of minimum
#        bid amount.
#    Default: false
#
#    CustomFT_AuctionHouseBot.Buyer.PreventOverpayingForVendorItems
#        When enabled, the buyer bot will avoid purchasing auction house items
#        that are being sold for more than the vendor sell price. This prevents
#        players from "gaming" the economy by flipping vendor items.
#        If disabled, the bot may still purchase vendor items above vendor value
#        if they fall within the acceptable price modifier rules.
#    Default: true
#
#    CustomFT_AuctionHouseBot.Buyer.BidAgainstPlayers
#        When enabled, the buyer bot will post bids against auctions that players
#        bid against, within the acceptable price range the buyer bot was willing
#        to pay
#    Default: false
